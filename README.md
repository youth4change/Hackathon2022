# Hackathon 2022

Topic 1: 
The goal of the Hackathon problem is to create a for-the-user application that manages a simple three-product supply change. This app may be a command line or GUI app. There will be a basic template to start from. More will be explained inside the Hackathon.

Topic 2:
Another goal of the Hackathon is to create a for-the-user application that helps the disabled. It maybe in anyway that it does so, but it does have to. This app has to be a GUI app. More will be explained inside the hackathon.

Time Limit: 3 Hours

You may use the code in the demos folder for inspiration, but not for the app.

Try for GUI apps, but it is not required. 

The teams are in the teams folder so go and check them out.

Any language works!
